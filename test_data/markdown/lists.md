- Some *complex list tests*

- This one is loose
  * But it has a
  * tight sublist

1. This one is ordered
  6. And its sublist starts at 6
  * A second list block

<!-- Comment to break the list -->

A list can
  * interrupt a paragraph

    With a paragraph in the list

Only an ordered list that
  1. starts with 1

can interrupt a list, so
  6. this one didn't do it.
